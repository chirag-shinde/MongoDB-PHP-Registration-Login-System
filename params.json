This system conists of a Registration page, to register new users, a Login page, for registered users.\r\n\r\n2. A home page once a user logs in. \r\n\r\n3. It also contains register_action and login_action to handle the data from register and login page respectively. \r\n\r\n4. It has page access restrictions imposed using session such that a logged in user cannot access login or registration page and a user who is not logged in cannot access the home page. \r\n\r\n5. It uses hashing to store passwords. And the BCRYPT encryption method is used to encrypt and store the passwords as opposed to the md5 and sha1 encryptions. \r\n\r\n6. It consists of a seperate library file which contains the functions used in the system. \r\n\r\n7. It was made with learning in mind and I'm open to all improvements that can be made to the system. \r\n\r\n8. Feel free to use it as you please.\r\n\r\n9. I've also used Bootstrap but haven't uploaded the bootstrap files. You can use them by simply addding the bootstrap folders to the same directory as these files. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
